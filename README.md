# Personal Projects

This repository includes my personal projects focused on my personal interests, discovery of emerging data science technologies, and understanding of industry standards. From these personal projects I hope to gain insight into how data analysts and data scientists approach complex problems, how they solve them with readable, documented code, and provide actionable business insights.
